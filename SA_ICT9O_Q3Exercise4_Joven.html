	<p>As someone who's been to Boracay, a recommended must try is the banana boat! The banana boat is a fun activity and in my opinion was one of the best things I did at Boracay. Though, Caution! The banana boat is quite fast and it could throw you in the salty waters of the beach. But I feel like being thrown in the water is part of the fun and is what some tourists want to happen.</p>
